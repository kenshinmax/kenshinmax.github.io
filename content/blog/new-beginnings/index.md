In this article, we will take a look at how to get data out of FullStory using Segment Export.

### Segment Export

Segments in FullStory are based on how you want to organize a cohort of users.  Using different criteria or "filters" you can set criteria to refine your results.   When you login to FullStory, you land on the default Segment page, which consists of every event, user and session for the last 30 days.
