Using different criteria or “filters” you can refine a cohort of users that you want to analyze by mix and match User and Event criteria.  This is extremely helpful as you start to create and test different hypothesis.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/0f98f/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"FullStory Segment\"\n        title=\"FullStory Segment\"\n        src=\"/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/828fb/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/ff44c/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg 158w,\n/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/a6688/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg 315w,\n/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/828fb/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg 630w,\n/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/0ede0/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg 945w,\n/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/3ac88/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg 1260w,\n/static/8450c6327b3405ccfd6420f8605af85f/0f98f/fullstory-segments-star-recent.jpg 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In some cases, you may want to export data collected by Fullstory to analyze with other tools, like Tableau or Domo.

As a rule of thumb, waiting 24 hours before exporting data for best results.  These export files are available for 7 days from when the export is completed.</p>\n<h3>Use the FullStory API</h3>\n<p>Great news, with the FullStory API you can automate the export process.  It’s a three step process. First, make a request to FullStory to kick-off the export process <a href=\"https://developer.fullstory.com/create-segment-export\">Create Segment Export API</a>.  Next, make  a request to the Export Operations API to get the ID for the finished data export operation (operation ID).  Lastly, make a request to the export results API to get the actual file location to download.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.fullstory.com/create-segment-export\">https://developer.fullstory.com/create-segment-export</a>\n<a href=\"https://developer.fullstory.com/get-operation\">https://developer.fullstory.com/get-operation</a>\n<a href=\"https://developer.fullstory.com/get-export-results\">https://developer.fullstory.com/get-export-results</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Data Destinations</h3>\n<p>When she reached the first hills of the <strong>Italic Mountains</strong>, she had a last\nview back on the skyline of her hometown <em>Bookmarksgrove</em>, the headline of\n<a href=\"http://google.com\">Alphabet Village</a> and the subline of her own road, the Line\nLane.
